        question: "How often should I exercise?",
        answer: "It's recommended to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, spread over at least 3 days per week. Additionally, it's also recommended to incorporate strength training exercises for all major muscle groups into your routine, at least two days per week."
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "What time of day is best to work out?",
        answer: "The best time of day to work out is subjective and depends on your personal schedule and preferences. Some people prefer to exercise in the morning, as it can help to boost energy levels and set a positive tone for the day. Others prefer to exercise in the evening as a way to unwind and relieve stress after a long day.The most important factor is finding a time that works best for you and sticking to a consistent routine. Consistency is key for seeing results and maintaining a regular exercise habit."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "How long should my workouts be?",
        answer: "A typical workout session can range from 30 minutes to an hour. The recommended minimum amount of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is 150 minutes per week, which breaks down to about 22 minutes a day, 5 days a week. However, the exact duration of your workout can depend on your fitness level, goals, and available time. It's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "Do I need to warm up before my workouts?",
        answer: "Yes, it's recommended to warm up before exercising to help prepare your body for physical activity and reduce the risk of injury. A warm-up can consist of 5-10 minutes of light aerobic activity such as jogging or jumping jacks, dynamic stretching, or a combination of both. The warm-up should increase your heart rate, loosen your muscles, and improve your range of motion. This preparation helps to make your workout more effective and reduce the risk of injury."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Should I do strength training, cardio or both?",
        answer: "Both strength training and cardio are important for overall physical fitness. Strength training helps to build and maintain muscle mass, increase bone density, and improve physical function. Cardiovascular exercise helps to improve cardiovascular health, increase endurance, and burn calories. It's recommended to include both types of exercise in your routine for the best results. "
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "Should I lift weights for strength training?",
        answer: "Yes, lifting weights is an effective way to strengthen your muscles and improve overall physical fitness. Strength training can include using weight machines, free weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. The amount of weight you use and the number of repetitions you perform will depend on your goals and current fitness level.It's important to use proper form and start with lighter weights, gradually increasing the weight as your muscles become stronger. Strength training should be performed at least two days per week, with one day of rest between sessions to allow your muscles time to recover. A certified personal trainer or physical therapist can help you create a safe and effective strength training program."
